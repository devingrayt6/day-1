    <h2 class="text-center">Some Background!</h2>
    <p>I recently moved to Idaho from Utah about a year and a half ago with my wife Juliette. We moved here so she can
      attend flight school and learn to fly helicopters. I have always been very interested in tech and coding and even
      spent an entire semester of college skipping classes to complete the freecodecamp program. I love all things
      running, swimming, and biking. I am a nerd, an athelete, and a strategy game enthusiast! I am very excited to
      experience the CodeWorks class. I have been looking for a long time to find a bootcamp, trade school, or some form
      of education that can fill the gaps I have as a self taught programmer.</p>
